      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Make a project site that can display stuff I am working on on various pages. Some pages may be small games in js, others might be a gallery of videos or images. Just a beginning exploration into making something useful to put on the web. My personal goal is to emulate janky websites from the old web days where it was just some dude making a blog with awful colors and flashy lights. The value add for this website will be basically nothing other than what is shown on the face. I want visitors to the sit to be left with a small moment of joy or something silly like that. No information will be necessary to interact with the site. </p>
      <p>The first page will be a test page describing practice with CSS and showing a few ways to do so.</p>  
      <p>The second page will be a little birthday page with pictures, a comment board, a video embed, and a full page background.</p>
      <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience for this website is going to be pretty much just me and my friends.</p>


      <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>The dynamic elements of my page that involve JS will include the nav menu, a dropdown menu for smaller screens, and in the mspaint project, most of the function will be from the js entirely. Drawing, ereasing, saving the drawing, and so on are all dynamic from the JS. </p>

      <h3>Website Logo</h3>

      <h3>Home page Content</h3>
      <p>
        This website is a project site linking to all the stuff I am willing to show publicly. My name is Grayden Stevens, and these are some of the web develeopment projects I work on in my spare time. The primary purpose of this page is to show off those projects, but I will be omitting some of my work out of respect for people's privacy, my own included. Among my projects, I often play with malware and sensitive data through my exploration of cybersecurity topics.

      <h3>Drawing Board Content</h3>

      <h2>Browser-Based Painting!</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this page is to demonstrate the ability to make dynamic painting possible in browsers using just JS
        and some tricky code. Feel free to experiment, draw, save, and do whatever you like with this proof-of-concept. </p>
      <p>Note: The paint bucket tool was planned for implementation, but when I tried to get the math to work by replacing
        every pixel that failed a specific check, I rapidly ran into a browser crashing bug. Turns out, doing tons and tons of
        math to check every adjacent pixel and replace it with the selected color is not the proper way to implement this
        feature! I figured it wasn't super important and left it behind as an artifact of failed effort.</p>

        This is a birthday page templater so I can make quick birthday pages and host them under new names whenever I wanna gift one to a family or friend. Pretty self explanatory. Nothing complex.

        This page is an artboard. People can draw with tools and colors, then save their creation locally. It's going to be the hardest subpage for sure.
